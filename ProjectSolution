1. Find the average fare of each class?

A = load'/FlumeData.1473037122210.tmp' using PigStorage(',') as (id:chararray,survived:chararray,Pclass:chararray,name:chararray,sex:chararray,age:int,sibsp:chararray,parch:chararray,ticket:chararray,fare:float,cabin:chararray,embarked:chararray);
B = foreach A generate Pclass,fare;
C = group B by Pclass;
D = foreach C generate group,AVG(B.fare);
Dump D;


2. FInd the number of people are alive in each class and are embarked in Southampton?

A = load'/FlumeData.1473037122210.tmp' using PigStorage(',') as (id:chararray,survived:chararray,Pclass:chararray,name:chararray,sex:chararray,age:int,sibsp:chararray,parch:chararray,ticket:chararray,fare:float,cabin:chararray,embarked:chararray);
B = foreach A generate Pclass,embarked,survived;
C = filter B by embarked=='S' and survived=='0';
D = foreach C generate Pclass,survived;
E = group D by Pclass;
F = foreach E generate group,COUNT(D.survived)as alive;
Dump F;


3. Find out number of male and female died in each class?

A = load'/FlumeData.1473037122210.tmp' using PigStorage(',') as (id:chararray,survived:chararray,Pclass:chararray,name:chararray,sex:chararray,age:int,sibsp:chararray,parch:chararray,ticket:chararray,fare:float,cabin:chararray,embarked:chararray);

B = foreach A generate Pclass,sex,survived;
C = filter B by survived=='1';
D = foreach C generate Pclass,sex;
E = filter D by sex =='male';
M = foreach E generate Pclass,sex;
G = group M by Pclass;
I  = foreach G generate group,COUNT(M.sex) as male;
F = filter D by sex =='female';
N = foreach F generate Pclass,sex;
H = group N by Pclass;
J = foreach H generate group,COUNT(N.sex) as female;
K = join I by group,J by group;
Dump K;
